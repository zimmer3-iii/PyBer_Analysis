# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview of Project
This project analyzes data from a ride sharing company Pyber.
Deliverables requested and provided are listed here:

 1. A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
 - There are 3 types of cities:
	- Urban
	- Suburban
	- Rural
 - For each city type we will find:
	- Total Rides
	- Total Drivers
	- Total Fares
	- Average Fare per Ride
	- Average Fare per Driver
	
 2.  A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type from 2019-01-01 to 2019-04-29


## Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Jupyter Notebook, anaconda 1.9.0
	
## Results
The data summary for each of the three city types below shows the following:
- Total Rides
- Total Drivers
- Total Fares
- Average Fare per Ride
- Average Fare per Driver

## Summary

### Rural Cities
Looking at the data summary we can see that rural rides charge the most per ride and get the most fare per drivers needed. 
The rural cities have the lowest total fares collected because the rural cities have the least amount of rides.
### Suburban Cities
Looking at the data summary we can see that suburban rides charge per ride and fare per drivers needed is in the middle between the rural and urban cities. 
The suburban cities also are in the middle for total fares collected and amount of rides.
### Urban Cities
Looking at the data summary we can see that urban rides charge the least per ride and get the least fare per drivers needed. 
The urban cities have the highest total fares collected because the urban cities have the highest amount of rides.
### Monthly
The chart shows that all the city types have ups and downs that are proportional to each other. 
Looking at the chart we can quickly see the major take away that is the urban rides consistently bring in the most total fare.
